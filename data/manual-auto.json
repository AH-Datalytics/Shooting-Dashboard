All other offense types are counted by incidents. | Non-Fatal Shootings and Carjackings are a subset of  existing UCR categories and are otherwise already included in Offense totals, counting by victims and incidents respectively. | Incidents without location coordinates available are coded as null locations but included in Citywide totals. Coordinates are aggregated into 0.1 square mile hexagons and defined geographic areas (Police Districts, Squad Areas, Neighborhoods, and Aldermanic Districts) based upon City of Milwaukee Information Technology Management Division (ITMD) Geographic Information Systems (GIS) shapefiles when that information is not otherwise already entered in the Records Management System (RMS). | Incidents are mapped for the prior 365 days. Specific incident locations and names of persons involved have not been included to protect the identity of the individuals. | Information may not yet be fully verified and may include mechanical and/or human error. Preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon further investigation(s). | Select Comparison Time | 4-Week to 4-Week | © Mapbox© OSM | 1 | 166 | Select Geography | Police District | Filter | Select Location | Inclusive | (All) | Offense Type | Part I Crime | Non-Fatal | Shooting | Carjacking | Download PDF | Data Current Through: | 2/19/2026 | 2024 | 2025 | % CHANGE | 2024-25 | YTD | 2024 | YTD | 2025 | YTD | 2026 | % CHANGE | YTD | 2024-26 | % CHANGE | YTD | 2025-26 | OFFENSE | FULL YEAR | YEAR-TO-DATE | COMPARISON | TIME FRAME | 1/25/2026 | - | 2/21/2026 | % CHANGE | TIME | FRAME | 12/28/2025 | - | 1/24/2026 | 0 | 20 | 40 | 60 | 80 | Nov 26, 25 | Dec 3, 25 | Dec 10, 25 | Dec 17, 25 | Dec 24, 25 | Dec 31, 25 | Jan 7, 26 | Jan 14, 26 | Jan 21, 26 | Jan 28, 26 | Feb 4, 26 | Feb 11, 26 | Feb 18, 26 | Select a Time Period | 12-Week | Weekly Incident Trend Analysis | Based on selected Time Period | 2026 Incident Date/Time Analysis | Based on selected Time Period | for crimes reported in 2026 | Incident Map | Prior 365 Days | 0 | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | Mon. | Tue. | Wed. | Thu. | Fri. | Sat. | Sun. | Select a Time Period | Day of Week | Homicide | Rape | Robbery | Aggravated | Assault | Human | Trafficking | Burglary | Theft | Motor Vehicle | Theft | Arson | View on Tableau Public | Undo | Redo | Revert | Replay Animation | Replay Speed Options | Download | Full Screen | Share",
