Coordinates are aggregated into 0.1 square mile hexagons and defined geographic areas (Police Districts, Squad Areas, Neighborhoods, and Aldermanic Districts) based upon City of Milwaukee Information Technology Management Division (ITMD) Geographic Information Systems (GIS) shapefiles when that information is not otherwise already entered in the Records Management System (RMS). | Incidents are mapped for the prior 365 days.
