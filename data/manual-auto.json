All other offense types are counted by incidents. | Non-Fatal Shootings and Carjackings are a subset of  existing UCR categories and are otherwise already included in Offense totals, counting by victims and incidents respectively. | Incidents without location coordinates available are coded as null locations but included in Citywide totals. Coordinates are aggregated into 0.1 square mile hexagons and defined geographic areas (Police Districts, Squad Areas, Neighborhoods, and Aldermanic Districts) based upon City of Milwaukee Information Technology Management Division (ITMD) Geographic Information Systems (GIS) shapefiles when that information is not otherwise already entered in the Records Management System (RMS). | Incidents are mapped for the prior 365 days. Specific incident locations and names of persons involved have not been included to protect the identity of the individuals. | Information may not yet be fully verified and may include mechanical and/or human error.
